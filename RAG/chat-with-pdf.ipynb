Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)\\n\\n3.Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning).\\n\\n1.

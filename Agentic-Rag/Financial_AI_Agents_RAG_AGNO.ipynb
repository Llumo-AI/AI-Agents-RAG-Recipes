As a result, ATVI is no longer a publicly traded company with independently reported financial data. Financial performance is now consolidated within Microsoft's reports, making it difficult to isolate ATVI's specific financials.\\n*   **Integration into Xbox Game Pass:** The integration of Activision Blizzard games into Xbox Game Pass further complicates the financial picture. Revenue streams are now intertwined with the Game Pass subscription model, making it harder to assess individual game performance and revenue.\\n*   **Time Lag in Integration:** The integration process is complex, and it takes time to fully integrate Activision Blizzard's operations and financial reporting into Microsoft's systems.
